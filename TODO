* Style category button (or panel) closer to Qt Creator (Designer) look 
  or like to LibreOffice Writer Properties Tool Box on the right side

* Improve pages behaviour in Qt Designer similar to QToolBox: 
  now Designer does not change currentPageIndex PROPERTY and focus on page or category click for some reason
  
* Improve pages geometry resizing to content and their layout on design time and on run-time.

Hope for community help on these improvements.
